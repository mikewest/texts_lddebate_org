PREFACE                                                                     
                        PREFACE TO THE READER                               
-                                                                           
  I HAVE already slightly touched upon the questions respecting the         
existence of God and the nature of the human soul, in the  Discourse        
on the Method of rightly conducting the Reason, and seeking truth in        
the Sciences,  published in French in the year 1637; not, however,          
with the design of there treating of them fully, but only, as it were,      
in passing, that I might learn from the judgments of my readers in          
what way I should afterwards handle them: for these questions appeared      
to me to be of such moment as to be worthy of being considered more         
than once, and the path which I follow in discussing them is so little      
trodden, and so remote from the ordinary route, that I thought it           
would not be expedient to illustrate it at greater length in French,        
and in a discourse that might be read by all, lest even the more            
feeble minds should believe that this path might be entered upon by         
them.                                                                       
  But, as in the discourse on Method, I had requested all who might         
find aught meriting censure in my writings, to do me the favour of          
pointing it out to me, I may state that no objections worthy of remark      
have been alleged against what I then said on these questions,              
except two, to which I will here briefly reply, before undertaking          
their more detailed discussion.                                             
  The first objection is that though, while the human mind reflects on      
itself, it does not perceive that it is any other than a thinking           
thing, it does not follow that its nature or essence consists only          
in its being a thing which thinks; so that the word  only  shall            
exclude all other things which might also perhaps be said to pertain        
to the nature of the mind.                                                  
  To this objection I reply, that it was not my intention in that           
place to exclude these according to the order of truth in the matter        
(of which I did not then treat), but only according to the order of         
thought (perception); so that my meaning was, that I clearly                
apprehended nothing, so far as I was conscious, as belonging to my          
essence, except that I was a thinking thing, or a thing possessing          
in itself the faculty of thinking. But I will show hereafter how, from      
the consciousness that nothing besides thinking belongs to the essence      
of the mind, it follows that nothing else does in truth belong to it.       
  The second objection is that it does not follow, from my                  
possessing the idea of a thing more perfect than I am, that the idea        
itself is more perfect than myself, and much less that what is              
represented by the idea exists.                                             
  But I reply that in the term  idea  there is here something               
equivocal; for it may be taken either materially for an act of the          
understanding, and in this sense it cannot be said to be more               
perfect than I, or objectively, for the thing represented by that act,      
which, although it be not supposed to exist out of my understanding,        
may, nevertheless, be more perfect than myself, by reason of its            
essence. But, in the sequel of this treatise I will show more amply         
how, from my possessing the idea of a thing more perfect than               
myself, it follows that this thing really exists.                           
  Besides these two objections, I have seen, indeed, two treatises          
of sufficient length relating to the present matter. In these,              
however, my conclusions, much more than my premises, were impugned,         
and that by arguments borrowed from the common-places of the atheists.      
But, as arguments of this sort can make no impression on the minds          
of those who shall rightly understand my reasonings, and as the             
judgments of many are so irrational and weak that they are persuaded        
rather by the opinions on a subject that are first presented to             
them, however false and opposed to reason they may be, than by a            
true and solid, but subsequently received, refutation of them, I am         
unwilling here to reply to these strictures from a dread of being,          
in the first instance, obliged to state them.                               
  I will only say, in general, that all which the atheists commonly         
allege in favour of the non-existence of God arises continually from        
one or other of these two things, namely, either the ascription of          
human affections to deity, or the undue attribution to our minds of so      
much vigour and wisdom that we may essay to determine and comprehend        
both what God can and ought to do; hence all that is alleged by them        
will occasion us no difficulty, provided only we keep in remembrance        
that our minds must be considered finite, while Deity is                    
incomprehensible and infinite.                                              
  Now that I have once, in some measure, made proof of the opinions of      
men regarding my work, I again undertake to treat of God and the human      
soul, and at the same time to discuss the principles of the entire          
first philosophy, without, however, expecting any commendation from         
the crowd for my endeavours, or a wide circle of readers. On the            
contrary, I would advise none to read this work, unless such as are         
able and willing to meditate with me in earnest, to detach their minds      
from commerce with the senses, and likewise to deliver themselves from      
all prejudice; and individuals of this character are, I well know,          
remarkably rare. But with regard to those who, without caring to            
comprehend the order and connection of the reasonings, shall study          
only detached clauses for the purpose of small but noisy criticism, as      
is the custom with many, I may say that such persons will not profit        
greatly by the reading of this treatise; and although perhaps they may      
find opportunity for cavilling in several places, they will yet hardly      
start any pressing objections, or such as shall be deserving of reply.      
  But since, indeed, I do not promise to satisfy others on all these        
subjects at first sight, nor arrogate so much to myself as to               
believe that I have been able to foresee all that may be the source of      
difficulty to each one, I shall expound, first of all, in the               
 Meditations,  those considerations by which I feel persuaded that I        
have arrived at a certain and evident knowledge of truth, in order          
that I may ascertain whether the reasonings which have prevailed            
with myself will also be effectual in convincing others. I will then        
reply to the objections of some men, illustrious for their genius           
and learning, to whom these meditations were sent for criticism before      
they were committed to the press; for these objections are so numerous      
and varied that I venture to anticipate that nothing, at least nothing      
of any moment, will readily occur to any mind which has not been            
touched upon in them.                                                       
  Hence it is that I earnestly entreat my readers not to come to any        
judgment on the questions raised in the meditations until they have         
taken care to read the whole of the objections, with the relative           
replies.
