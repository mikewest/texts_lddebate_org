<h3 align="center"><font size="3">APPENDIX II</font></h3>

<p align="center"><font size="3">OF THE HARMONY WHICH THE
TRANSCENDENTAL CONCEPT OF PUBLIC RIGHT ESTABLISHES BETWEEN
MORALITY AND POLITICS</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If, like the teacher of law, I abstract from
all the material of public law (i.e., abstract from the various
empirically given relationships of men in the state or of states
to each other), there remains only the <em>form</em> of
publicity, the possibility of which is implied by every legal
claim, since without it there can be no justice (which can only
be conceived as publicly known) and thus no right, since it can
be conferred only in accordance with justice. Every legal claim
must be capable of publicity. Since it is easy to judge whether
it is so in a particular case, i.e., whether it can be compatible
with the principles of the agent, this gives an easily applied
criterion found a priori in reason, by which the falsity
(opposition to law) of the pretended claim (<em>prae</em><i>tensio
iuris) </i>can, as it were, be immediately known by an experiment
of pure reason.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Having set aside everything empirical in the
concept of civil or international law (such as the wickedness in
human nature which necessitates coercion), we can call the
following proposition the transcendental formula of public law:
&quot;All actions relating to the right of other men are unjust
if their maxim is not consistent with publicity.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This principle is to be regarded not merely as
ethical (as belonging to the doctrine of virtue) but also as
juridical (concerning the right of man). A maxim which I cannot
divulge without defeating my own purpose must be kept secret if
it is to succeed; and, if I cannot publicly avow it Without
inevitably exciting universal opposition to my project, the
necessary and universal opposition which can be foreseen a priori
is due only to the injustice with which the maxim threatens
everyone. This principle is, furthermore, only negative, i.e., it
only serves for the recognition of what is not just to others.
Like an axiom, it is indemonstrably certain and, as will be seen
in the following examples of public law, easily applied.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1. In the law of the state <i>(ius civitatis) </i>or
domestic law, there is a question which many hold to be difficult
to answer, yet it is easily solved by the transcendental
principle of publicity. The question is: &quot;Is rebellion a
legitimate means for a people to employ in throwing off the yoke
of an alleged tyrant (<em>non</em> <i>titulo, sed exercitio
talis)?&quot; </i>The rights of the people are injured; no
injustice befalls the tyrant when he is deposed. There can be no
doubt on this point. Nevertheless, it is in the highest degree
illegitimate for the subjects to seek their rights in this way.
If they fail in the struggle and are then subjected to severest
punishment, they cannot complain about injustice any more than
the tyrant could if they had succeeded.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If one wishes to decide this question by a
dogmatic deduction of legal grounds, there can be much arguing
pro and con; only the transcendental principle of the publicity
of public law can free us of this prolixity. According to this
principle, a people would ask itself before the establishment of
the civil contract whether it dare publish the maxim of its
intention to revolt on occasion. It is clear that if, in the
establishment of a constitution, the condition is made that the
people may in certain cases employ force against its chief, the
people would have to pretend to a legitimate power over him, and
then he would not be the chief. Or if both are made the condition
of the establishment of the state, no state would be possible,
though to establish it was the purpose of the people. The
illegitimacy of rebellion is thus clear from the fact that its
maxim, if openly acknowledged, would make its own purpose
impossible. Therefore, it would have to be kept secret. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This secrecy, however, is not incumbent upon
the chief of the state. He can openly say that he will punish
every rebellion with the death of the ringleaders, however much
they may believe that he was the first to overstep the basic law;
for when he knows he possesses irresistible power (which must be
assumed to be the case in every civil constitution, because he
who does not have enough power to protect the people against
every other also does not have the right to command them), he
need not fear vitiating his own purpose by publishing his maxims.
If the revolt of the people succeeds, what has been said is still
quite compatible with the fact that the chief, on retiring to the
status of a subject, cannot begin a revolt for his restoration
but need not fear being made to account for his earlier
administration of the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. We can speak of international law only under
the presupposition of some law-governed condition, i.e., of the
external condition under which right can really be awarded to
man. For, being a public law, it contains in its very concept the
public announcement of a general will which assigns to each his
rights, and this <i>status iuridicus </i>must result from some
compact which is not founded on laws of compulsion 'as in the
case of the compact from which a single state arises). Rather, it
must be founded on a free and enduring association, like the
previously mentioned federation of states. For without there
being some juridical condition, which actively binds together the
different physical or moral persons, there can be only private
law; this is the situation met with in the state of nature. Now
here there is a conflict of politics with morality (regarding the
latter as a science of right), and the criterion of publicity
again finds an easy application in resolving it, though only if
the compact between the states has been made with the purpose of
preserving peace between them and other states, and not for
conquest. The following cases of the antinomy between politics
and morality occur (and they are stated with their solution). </font><font
size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">a) &quot;If one of these states has promised
something to the other, such as aid, cession of some province,
subsidies, and the like, and a case arises where the salvation of
the state depends upon its being relieved of its promise, can it
then consider itself in two roles: first as a sovereign (as it is
responsible to no one in the state), and second as merely the
highest official (who must give an account to the state)? From
this dual capacity it would follow that in its latter role the
state can relieve itself of what it has obliged itself to do in
its former role.&quot; But if a state (or its chief) publicizes
this maxim, others would naturally avoid entering an alliance
with it, or ally themselves with others so as to resist such
pretensions. This proves that politics with all its cunning would
defeat its purpose by candor; therefore, that maxim must be
illegitimate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>b) </i>&quot;If a neighboring power becomes
formidable by its acquisitions (<em>potentia tremenda</em>), and
thus causes anxiety, can one assume because it can oppress that
it <i>will? </i>And does this give the lesser power, in union
with others, a right to attack it without having.first been
injured by it?&quot; A state which made known that such was its
maxim would produce the feared evil even more certainly and
quickly, for the greater power would steal a march on the
smaller. And the alliance of the smaller powers would be only a<b>
</b>feeble reed against one who knew how to apply the maxim <i>divide
et impera. </i>This maxim of political expediency, if made
public, would necessarily defeat its<b> </b>own purpose, and
hence it is illegitimate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&nbsp;<i>c) </i>&quot;If a smaller state is so
situated as<b> </b>to break up the territory of a larger one, and
continuous territory is necessary to the preservation of the
larger, is the latter not justified in subjugating the smaller
and incorporating it?&quot; We easily see that the greater power
cannot afford to let this maxim become known; otherwise the
smaller states would very early unite, or other powers would
dispute the prey, and thus publicity would render this maxim
impracticable. This is a sign that it is illegitimate. It may be
unjust to a very high degree, for a small object of injustice
does not prevent the injustice from being very great.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">3. I say nothing about the law of world
citizenship, for its analogy with international law makes it a
very simple matter to state and evaluate its maxims.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thus in the principle of incompatibility
between the maxims of international law and publicity we have a
good distinguishing mark for recognizing the nonconformity of
politics to morality (as a, science of right). Now we need to
know the condition under which these maxims, agree with the law
of nations, for we cannot infer conversely that the maxims which
bear publicity are therefore just, since no one who has decidedly
superior power needs to conceal his plans. The condition of the
possibility of international law in general is this: a juridical
condition must first exist. For without this there is no public
law, since all law which one may think of outside of this, in the
state of nature, is merely private law. We have seen that a
federation of states which has for its sole purpose the
maintenance of peace is the only juridical condition compatible
with the freedom of the several states. Therefore the harmony of
politics with morals is possible only in a federative alliance,
and the latter is necessary and given a priori by the principle
of right. Furthermore, all politics has for its juridical basis
the establishment of this harmony to its greatest possible
extent, and without this end all its sophisms are but folly and
veiled injustice. This false politics outdoes the best Jesuit
school in casuistry. It has <i>reservatio mentalis, </i>wording
public compacts with such expressions as can on occasion be
interpreted to one's own advantage (for example, it makes the
distinction between <i>status quo de fait </i>and <i>de droit). </i>It
has <em>probabilism</em>, attributing hostile intentions to
others, or even making probabilities of their possible superior
power into legal grounds for destroying other, peaceful states.
Finally, it has the <em>peccatum</em> <i>philosophicum
(peccatillum, bagatelle), </i>holding it to be only a trifle when
a small state is swallowed up in order that a much larger one may
thereby approach more nearly to an alleged greater good for the
world as a whole. </font><a href="#fn1"><font size="3">1</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">The duplicity of politics in respect to
morality, in using first one branch of it and then the other for
its purposes, furthers these sophistic maxims. These branches are
philanthropy and respect for the rights of men; and both are
duty. The former is a conditional duty, while the latter is an
unconditional and absolutely mandatory duty. One who wishes to
give himself up to the sweet feeling of benevolence must make
sure that he has not transgressed this absolute duty. Politics
readily agrees with morality in its first branch (as ethics) in
order to surrender the rights of men to their superiors. But with
morality in the second branch (as a science of right), to which
it must bend its knee, politics finds it advisable not to have
any dealings, and rather denies it all reality, preferring to
educe all duties to mere benevolence. This artifice of a
secretive politics would soon be unmasked by philosophy through
publication of its maxims, if they only dared to allow the
philosopher to publish his maxims.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this regard I propose another affirmative
and transcendental principle of public law, the formula of which
is:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">&quot;All maxims which <em>stand in need</em>
of publicity in order not to fail their end, agree with politics
and right combined.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For if they can attain their end only through
publicity, they must accord with the public's universal end,
happiness; and the proper task of politics is,to promote this,
i.e., to make the public satisfied with its condition. If,
however, this end is attainable only by means of publicity, i.e.,
by removing all distrust in the maxims of politics, the latter
must conform to the rights of the public, for only in this is the
union of the goals of all possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The further development and discussion of this
principle I must postpone to another occasion. But that it is a
transcendental formula is to be seen from the exclusion of all
empirical conditions (of the doctrine of happiness) as material
of the law, and from the reference it makes to the form of
universal lawfulness.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If it is a duty to make real (even if only
through approximation in endless progress) the state of public
law, and if there is well-grounded hope that this can actually be
done, then perpetual peace, as the condition that will follow
what has erroneously been called &quot;treaties of peace&quot;
(but which in reality are only armistices), is not an empty idea.
As the times required for equal steps of progress become, we
hope, shorter and shorter, perpetual peace is a problem which,
gradually working out its own solution, steadily approaches its
goal. </font></p>

size="3"> The precedents for such maxims may be seen in Counselor
Garve's treatise, On <i>the Union of Morality with Politics </i>(1788).
This worthy scholar admits in the beginning that he is not able
to solve the problem completely. But to approve of this union
while admitting that one cannot meet all objections which may be
raised against it seems to show more tolerance than is,,advisable
toward those who are inclined to abuse it.</font></p>
