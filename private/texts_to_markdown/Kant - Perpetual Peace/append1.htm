<h3 align="center"><font size="3">APPENDIX I</font></h3>

<p align="center"><font size="3">ON THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN MORALITY AND POLITICS WITH
RESPECT TO PERPETUAL PEACE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Taken objectively, morality is in itself practical, being the totality
of unconditionally mandatory laws according to which we ought to act. It would obviously
be absurd, after granting authority to the concept of duty, to pretend that we cannot do
our duty, for in that case this concept would itself drop out of morality (<em>ultra</em> <i>posse
nemo obli</i>g<em>atur</em>). Consequently, there can be no conflict of politics, as a
practical doctrine of right, with ethics, as a theoretical doctrine of right. That is to
say, there is no conflict of practice with theory, unless by ethics we mean a general
doctrine of prudence, which would be the same as a theory of the maxims for choosing the
most fitting means to accomplish the purposes of self-interest. But to give this meaning
to ethics is equivalent to denying that there is any such thing at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Politics says, &quot;Be ye wise as serpents&quot;; morality adds, as a
limiting condition, &quot;and guileless as doves.&quot; If these two injunctions are
incompatible in a single command, then politics and morality are really in conflict; but
if these two qualities ought always to be united, the thought of contrariety is absurd,
and the question as to how the conflict between morals and politics is to be resolved
cannot even be posed as a problem. Although the proposition, &quot;Honesty is the best
policy,&quot; implies a theory which practice unfortunately often refutes, the equally
theoretical &quot;Honesty is better than any policy&quot; is beyond refutation and is
indeed the indispensable condition of policy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The tutelary divinity of morality yields not to Jupiter, for this
tutelary divinity of force still is subject to destiny. That is, reason is not yet
sufficiently enlightened to survey the entire series of predetermining causes, and such
vision would be necessary for one to be able to foresee with certainty the happy or
unhappy effects which follow human actions by the mechanism of nature (though we know
enough to have hope that they will accord with our wishes). But what we have to do in
order to remain in the path of duty (according to rules of wisdom) reason instructs us by
her rules, and her teaching suffices for attaining the ultimate end.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now the practical man, to whom morality is mere theory even though he
concedes that it can and should be followed, ruthlessly renounces our fond hope [that it
will be followed]. He does so because he pretends to have seen in advance that man, by his
nature, will never will what is required for realizing the goal of perpetual peace.
Certainly the will of each individual to live under a juridical constitution according to
principles of freedom (i.e., the distributive unity of the will of all) is not sufficient
to this end. That all together should will this condition (i.e., the collective unity of
the united will)--the solution to this troublous problem--is also required. Thus a whole
of civil society is formed. But since a uniting cause must supervene upon the variety of
particular volitions in order to produce a common will from them, establishing this whole
is something no one individual in the group can perform; hence in the practical execution
of this idea we can count on nothing but force to establish the juridical condition, on
the compulsion of which public law will later be established. We can scarcely hope to find
in the legislator a moral intention sufficient to induce him to commit to the general will
the establishment of a legal constitution after he has formed the nation from a horde of
savages; therefore, we cannot but expect (in practice) to find in execution wide
deviations from this idea (in theory).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It will then be said that he who once has power in his hands will not
allow the people to prescribe laws for him; a state which once is able to stand under no
external laws will not submit to the decision of other states how it should seek its
rights against them; and one continent, which feels itself superior to another, even
though the other does not interfere with it, will not neglect to increase its power by
robbery or even conquest. Thus all theoretical plans of civil and international laws and
laws of world citizenship vanish into empty and impractical ideas, while practice based on
empirical principles of human nature, not blushing to draw its maxims from the usages of
the world, can alone hope to find a sure ground for its political edifice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If there is no freedom and no morality based on freedom, and everything
which occurs or can occur happens by the mere mechanism of nature certainly politics
(which is the art of using this mechanism for ruling men) is the whole of practical
wisdom, and the concept of right is an empty thought. But if we find it necessary to
connect the latter with politics, and even to raise it to a limiting condition thereon,
the possibility of their being united must be conceded. I can easily conceive of a moral
politician, i.e., one who so chooses political principles that they are consistent with
those of morality; but I cannot conceive of a political moralist, one who forges a
morality in such a way that it conforms to the statesman's advantage.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When a remediable defect is found in the constitution of the state or in
its relations to others, the principle of the moral politician will be that it is a duty,
especially of the rulers of the state, to inquire how it can be remedied as soon as
possible in a way conforming to natural law as a model presented by reason; this he will
do even if it costs self-sacrifice. But it would be absurd to demand that every defect be
immediately and impetuously changed, since the disruption of the bonds of a civil society
or a union of world citizens before a better constitution is ready to take its place is
against all politics agreeing with morality. But it can be demanded that at least the
maxim of the necessity of such a change should be taken to heart by those in power, so
that they may continuously approach the goal of the constitution that is best under laws
of right. A state may exercise a republican rule, even though by its present constitution
it has a despotic sovereignty, until gradually the people becomes susceptible to the
influence simply of the idea of the authority of law (as if it possessed physical power)
and thus is found fit to be its own legislator (as its own legislation is originally
established on law). If a violent revolution, engendered by a bad constitution, introduces
by illegal means a more legal constitution, to lead the people back to the earlier
constitution would not be permitted; but, while the revolution lasted, each person who
openly or covertly shared in it would have justly incurred the punishment due to those who
rebel. As to the external relations of states, a state cannot be expected to renounce its
constitution even though it is a despotic one (which has the advantage of being stronger
in relation to foreign enemies) so long as it is exposed to the danger of being swallowed
up by other states. Thus even in the case of the intention to improve the constitution,
postponement to a more propitious time may be permitted.<a href="#fn1">1</a></font></p>

<p><font size="3">It may be that despotizing moralists, in practice blundering, often
violate rules of political prudence through measures they adopt or propose too
precipitately; but experience will gradually retrieve them from their infringement of
nature and lead them on to a better course. But the moralizing politician, by glossing
over principles of politics which are opposed to the right with the pretext that human
nature is not capable of the good as reason prescribes it, only makes reform impossible
and perpetuates the violation of law.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Instead of possessing the <i>practical science </i>they boast of, these
politicians have only <i>practices; </i>they flatter the power which is then ruling so as
not to be remiss in their private advantage, and they sacrifice the nation and, possibly,
the whole world. This is the way of all professional lawyers (not legislators) when they
go into politics. Their task is not to reason too nicely about the legislation but to
execute the momentary commands on the statute books; consequently, the legal constitution
in force at any time is to them the best, but when it is amended from above, this
amendment always seems best, too. Thus everything is preserved in its accustomed
mechanical order. Their adroitness in fitting into all -circumstances gives them the
illusion of being able to judge constitutional principles according to concepts of right
(not empirically, but a priori). They make a great show of understanding men (which is
certainly something to be expected of them, since they have to deal with so many) without
understanding man and what can be made of him, for they lack the higher point of view of
anthropological observation which is needed for this. If with these ideas they go into
civil and international law, as reason prescribes it, they take this step in a spirit of
chicanery, for they still follow their accustomed mechanical routine of despotically
imposed coercive laws in a field where only concepts of reason can establish a legal
compulsion according to the principles of freedom, under which alone a just and durable
constitution is possible. In this field the pretended practical man thinks he can solve
the problem of establishing such a constitution without the rational idea but solely from
the experience he has had with what was previously the most lasting constitutions
constitution which in many cases was opposed to the right.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The maxims which he makes use of (though he does not divulge them) are,
roughly speaking, the following sophisms:</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>1. Fac et excusa. </i>Seize every favorable opportunity for usurping
the right of the state over its own people or over a neighboring people; the justification
will be easier and more elegant <i>ex post facto, </i>and the power can be more easily
glossed over, especially when the supreme power in the state is also the legislative
authority which must be obeyed without argument. It is much more difficult to do the
violence when one has first to wait upon the consideration of convincing arguments and to
meet them with counterarguments. Boldness itself gives the appearance of inner conviction
of the legitimacy of the deed, and the god of success is afterward the best advocate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>2. Si fecisti, nega. </i>What you have committed, deny that it was
your fault--for instance, that you have brought your people to despair and hence to
rebellion. Rather assert that it was due to the obstinacy of your subjects; or, if you
have conquered a neighboring nation, say that the fault lies in the nature of man, who, if
not met by force, can be counted on to make use of it to conquer you. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>3. Divide et impera. </i>That is, if there are certain privileged
persons in your nation who have chosen you as their chief (<em>primus</em> <i>inter
pares), </i>set them at variance with one another and embroil them with the people. Show
the latter visions of greater freedom, and all will soon depend on your untrammeled will.
Or if it is foreign states that concern you, it is a pretty safe means to sow discord
among them so that, by seeming to protect the weaker, you can conquer them one after
another.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Certainly no one is now the dupe of these political maxims, for they are
already universally known. Nor are they blushed at, as if their injustice were too
glaring, for great powers blush only at the judgment of other great powers but not at that
of the common masses. it is not that they are ashamed of revealing such principles (for
all of them are in the same boat with respect to the morality of their maxims); they are
ashamed only when these maxims fail, for they still have political honor which cannot be
disputed--and this honor is the aggrandizement of their power by whatever means.<a
href="#fn2">2</a></font></p>

<p><font size="3">All these twistings and turnings of an immoral doctrine of prudence in
leading men from their natural state of war to a state of peace prove at least that men in
both their private and their public relationships cannot reject the concept of right or
trust themselves openly to establish politics merely on the artifices of prudence. Thus
they do not refuse obedience to the concept of public law, which is especially manifest in
international law; on the contrary, they give all due honor to it, even when they are
inventing a hundred pretenses and subterfuges to escape from it in practice, imputing its
authority, as the source and union of all laws, to crafty force.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Let us put an end to this sophism, if not to the injustice it protects,
and force the false representatives of power to confess that they do not plead in favor of
the right but in favor of might. This is revealed in the imperious tone they assume as if
they themselves could command the right. Let us remove the delusion by which they and
others are duped, and discover the supreme principle from which the intention to perpetual
peace stems. Let us show that everything evil which stands in its way derives from the
fact that the political moralist begins where the moral politician would correctly leave
off, and that, since he thus subordinates principles to the end (putting the cart before
the horse), he vitiates his own purpose of bringing politics into agreement with morality.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To make practical philosophy self-consistent, it is necessary, first, to
decide the question: In problems of practical reason, must we begin from its material
principles, i.e., the end as the object of choice? Or should we begin from the formal
principles of pure reason, i.e., from the principle which is concerned solely with freedom
in outer relations and which reads, &quot;So act that you can will that your maxim could
become a universal law, regardless of the end&quot;?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Without doubt it is the latter which has precedence, for as a principle
of law it has unconditional necessity. On the other hand, the former is obligatory only if
we presuppose the empirical conditions of the proposed end, i.e., its practicability. Thus
if this end (in this case, perpetual peace) is a duty, it must be derived from the formal
principle of the maxims of external actions. The first principle, that of the political
moralist, pertaining to civil and international law and the law of world citizenship, is
merely a problem of technique <i>(problema technicum); </i>the second, as the problem of
the moral politician to whom it is an ethical problem (<em>problema morale</em>), is far
removed from the other in its method of leading toward perpetual peace, which is wished
not merely as a material good but also as a condition issuing from an acknowledgment of
duty.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For the solution of the former, the problem of political prudence, much
knowledge of nature is required so that its mechanism may be employed toward the desired
end; yet all this is uncertain in its results for perpetual peace, with whatever sphere of
public law we,are concerned. It is uncertain, for example, whether the people are better
kept in obedience and maintained in prosperity by severity or by the charm of distinctions
which flatter their vanity, by the power of one or the union of various chiefs, or perhaps
merely by a serving nobility or by the power of the people. History furnishes us with
contradictory examples from all governments (with the exception of the truly republican,
which can alone appeal to the mind of a moral politician). Still more uncertain is an
international law allegedly erected on the statutes of ministries. It is, in fact, a word
without meaning, resting as it does on compacts which, in the very act of being concluded,
contain secret reservations for their violation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On the other hand, the solution of the second problem, that of political
wisdom, presses itself upon us, as it were; it is clear to everyone and puts to shame all
affectation. It leads directly to the end, but, remembering discretion, it does not
precipitately hasten to do so by force; rather, it continuously approaches it under the
conditions offered by favorable circumstances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Then it may be said, &quot;Seek ye first the kingdom of pure practical
reason and its righteousness, and your end (the blessing of perpetual peace) will
necessarily follow.&quot; For it is the peculiarity of morals, especially with respect to
its principles of public law and hence in relation to a politics known a priori, that the
less it makes conduct depend on the proposed end, i.e., the intended material or moral
advantage, the more it agrees with it in general. This is because it is the universal will
given a priori (in a nation or in the relations among different nations) which determines
the law among men, and if practice consistently follows it, this will can also, by the
mechanism of nature, cause the desired result and make the concept of law effective. So,
for instance, it is a principle of moral politics that a people should unite into a state
according to juridical concepts of freedom and equality, and this principle is based not
on prudence but on duty. Political moralists may argue as much as they wish about the
natural mechanism of a mass of men forming a society, assuming a mechanism which would
weaken those principles and vitiate their end; or they may seek to prove their assertions
by examples of poorly organized constitutions of ancient and modern times (for instance,
of democracies without representative systems). They deserve no hearing, particularly as
such a pernicious theory may itself occasion the evil which it prophesies, throwing human
beings into one class with all other living machines, differing from them only in their
consciousness that they are not free, which makes them, in their own judgment, the most
miserable of all beings in the world.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The true but somewhat boastful sentence which has become proverbial, <i>Fiat
iustitia, pereat </i><em>mundus</em> (&quot;Let justice reign even if all the rascals in
the world should perish from it&quot;), is a stout principle of right which cuts asunder
the whole tissue of artifice or force. But it should not be misunderstood as a permission
to use one's own right with extreme rigor (which would conflict with ethical duty); it
should be understood as the obligation of those in power not to limit or to extend
anyone's right through sympathy or disfavor. This requires, first, an internal
constitution of the state erected on pure principles of right, and, second, a convention
of the state with other near or distant states (analogous to a universal state) for the
legal settlement of their differences. This implies only that political maxims must not be
derived from the welfare or happiness which a single state expects from obedience to them,
and thus not from the end which one of them proposes for itself. That is, they must not be
deduced from volition as the supreme yet empirical principle of political wisdom, but
rather from the pure concept of the duty of right, from the ought whose principle is given
a priori by pure reason, regardless of what the physical consequences may be. The world
will by no means perish by a diminution in the number of evil men. Moral evil has the
indiscerptible property of being opposed to and destructive of its own purposes
(especially in the relationships between evil men); thus it gives place to the moral
principle of the good, though only through a slow progress.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thus objectively, or in theory, there is no conflict between morals and
politics. Subjectively, however, in the selfish propensity of men (which should not be
called &quot;practice,&quot; as this would imply that it rested on rational maxims), this
conflict will always remain. Indeed, it should remain, because it serves as a whetstone of
virtue, whose true courage (by the principle, <em>tu ne</em> <i>cede malis, sed contra
audentior ito</i></font><font size="2"> [Yield not to evil, but go against the
stronger&quot; <i>(Aeneid </i>VI. 95).]</font><font size="3">)<i> </i>in the present case
does not so much consist in defying with strong resolve evils and sacrifices which must be
undertaken along with the conflict, but rather in detecting and conquering the crafty and
far more dangerously deceitful and treasonable principle of evil in ourselves, which puts
forward the weakness of human nature as justification for every transgression.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In fact, the political moralist may say: The ruler and people, or nation
and nation, do each other no injustice when by violence or fraud they make war on each
other, although they do commit injustice in general in that they refuse to respect the
concept of right, which alone could establish perpetual peace. For since the one does
transgress his duty against the other, who is likewise lawlessly disposed toward him, each
gets what he deserves when they destroy each other. But enough of the race still remains
to let this game continue into the remotest ages in order that posterity, some day, might
take these perpetrators as a warning example. Hence providence is justified in the history
of the world, for the moral principle in man is never extinguished, while with advancing
civilization reason grows pragmatically in its capacity to realize ideas of law. But at
the same time the culpability for the transgressions also grows. If we assume that
humanity never will or can be improved, the only thing which a theodicy seems unable to
justify is creation itself, the fact that a race of such corrupt beings ever was on earth.
But the point of view necessary for such an assumption is far too high for us, and we
cannot theoretically support our philosophical concepts of the supreme power which is
inscrutable to us.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">To such dubious consequences we are inevitably driven if we do not
assume that pure principles of right have objective reality, i.e., that they may be
applied, and that the people in a state and, further, states themselves in their mutual
relations should act according to them, whatever objections empirical politics may raise.
Thus true politics can never take a step without rendering homage to morality. Though
politics by itself is a difficult art, its union with morality is no art at all, for this
union cuts the knot which politics could not untie when they were in conflict. The rights
of men must be held sacred, however much sacrifice it may cost the ruling power. One
cannot compromise here and seek the middle course of a pragmatic conditional law between
the morally right and the expedient. All politics must bend its knee before the right. But
by this it can hope slowly to reach the stage where it will shine with an immortal glory. </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font size="5">FOOTNOTES TO APPENDIX I</font></h3>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><a name="fn1">1.</a> These are permissive laws of reason.
Public law laden with injustice must be allowed to stand, either until everything is of
itself ripe for complete reform or until this maturity has been brought about by peaceable
means; for a legal constitution, even though it be right to only a low degree, is better
than none at all, the anarchic condition which would result from precipitate reform.
Political wisdom, therefore, will make it a duty to introduce reforms which accord with
the ideal of public law. But even when nature herself produces revolutions, political
wisdom will not employ them to legitimize still greater oppression. On the contrary, it
will use them as a call of nature for fundamental reforms to produce a lawful constitution
founded upon principles of freedom, for only such a constitution is durable.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><a name="fn2">2.</a> Even if we doubt a certain wickedness
in the nature of men who live together in a state, and instead plausibly cite lack of
civilization, which is not yet sufficiently advanced, i.e., regard barbarism as the cause
of those antilawful manifestations of their character, this viciousness is clearly and
incontestably shown in the foreign relations of states. Within each state it is veiled by
the compulsion of civil laws, because the inclination to violence between the citizens is
fettered by the stronger power of the government. This relationship not only gives a moral
veneer <i>(causae non causae) </i>to the whole but actually facilitates the development of
the moral disposition to a direct respect for the law by placing a barrier against the
outbreak of unlawful inclinations. Each person believes that he himself would hold the
concept of law sacred and faithfully follow it provided he were sure that he could expect
the same from others, and the government does in part assure him of this. Thereby a great
step (though not yet a moral step) is taken toward morality, which is attachment to this
concept of duty for its own sake and without regard to hope of a similar response from
others. But since each one with his own good opinion of himself presupposes a malicious
disposition on the part of all the others, they all pronounce the judgment that they in
fact are all worth very little. We shall not discuss how this comes about, though it
cannot be blamed on the nature of man as a free being. But since even respect for the
concept of right (which man cannot absolutely refuse to respect) solemnly sanctions the
theory that he has the capacity of conforming to it, everyone sees that he, for his part,
must act according to it, however others may act. </font></p>
