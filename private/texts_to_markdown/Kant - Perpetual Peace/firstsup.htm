  <p align="center"><font size="3">OF THE GUARANTEE FOR PERPETUAL PEACE</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The guarantee of perpetual peace is nothing less than that great artist,
nature (<em>natura daedala</em> <em>rerum)</em>. In her mechanical course we see that her
aim is to produce a harmony among men, against their will and indeed through their
discord. As a necessity working according to laws we do not know, we call it destiny. But,
considering its design in world history, we call it &quot;providence,&quot; inasmuch as we
discern in it the profound wisdom of a higher cause which predetermines the course of
nature and directs it to the objective final end of the human race.<a href="#fn1">1</a> We
do not observe or infer this providence in the cunning contrivances of nature, but, as in
questions of the relation of the form of things to ends in general, we can and must supply
it from our own minds in order to conceive of its possibility by analogy to actions of
human art. The idea of the relationship and harmony between these actions and the end
which reason directly assigns to us is transcendent from a theoretical point of view; from
a practical standpoint, with respect, for example, to the ideal of perpetual peace, the
concept is dogmatic and its<b> </b>reality is well established, and thus the mechanism of
nature may be employed to that end. The use of the word &quot;nature&quot; is more fitting
to the limits of human reason and more modest than an expression indicating a providence
unknown to us. This is especially true when we are dealing with questions of theory and
not<b> </b>of religion, as at present, for human reason in questions of the relation of
effects to their causes must remain within the limits of possible experience. On the other
hand, the use of the word &quot;providence&quot; here intimates the possession of wings
like those of Icarus, conducting us<b> </b>toward the secret of<b> </b>its unfathomable
purpose.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Before we more narrowly define the guarantee which nature<b> </b>gives,
it<b> </b>is necessary to<b> </b>examine the situation in which she has placed her actors
on her vast stage, a<b> </b>situation which finally assures peace among them. Then we
shall see how she accomplishes the latter<b>. </b>Her preparatory arrangements are:&nbsp;</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="3">1. In every region of the world she has made it<b> </b>possible for<b> </b>men
    to<b> </b>live.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">2. By war she has driven them even into the most inhospitable regions in
    order to populate them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">3. By the same means, she has forced them into more or less lawful
    relations with each other. &nbsp;</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">That<b> </b>in the cold wastes by the Arctic Ocean the moss grows which
the reindeer digs from the snow in order to make itself the prey or the conveyance of the
Ostyak or Samoyed; or that the saline sandy deserts are inhabited by the camel which
appears created as it were in order that they might not go unused--that is already
wonderful. Still clearer is the end when we see how besides the furry animals of the
Arctic there are also the seal, the walrus, and the whale which afford the inhabitants
food from their flesh and warmth from their blubber. But the care of nature excites the
greatest wonder when we see how she brings wood (though the inhabitants do not know whence
it comes) to these barren climates, without which they would have neither canoes, weapons,
nor huts, and when we see how these natives are so occupied with their war against the
animals that they live in peace with each other--but what drove them there was presumably
nothing else than war.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The first instrument of war among the animals which man learned to tame
and to domesticate was the horse (for the elephant belongs to later times, to the luxury
of already established states). The art of cultivating certain types of plants (grain)
whose original characteristics we do not know, and the increase and improvement of fruits
by transplantation and grafting (in Europe perhaps only the crab apple and the wild pear),
could arise only under conditions prevailing in already established states where property
was secure. Before this could take place, it was necessary that men who had first
subsisted in anarchic freedom by hunting,<a href="#fn2">2</a> fishing, and sheepherding
should have been forced into an agricultural life. Then salt and iron were discovered.
These were perhaps the first articles of commerce for the various peoples and were sought
far and wide; in this way a peaceful traffic among nations was established, and thus
understanding, conventions, and peaceable relations were established among the most
distant peoples.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As nature saw to it. that men could live everywhere in the world, she
also despotically willed that they should do so, even against their inclination and
without this ought being based on a concept of duty to which they were bound by a moral
law. She chose war as the means to this end. So we see peoples whose common language shows
that they have a common origin. For instance, the Samoyeds on the Arctic Ocean and a
people with a similar language a thousand miles away in the Altaian Mountains are
separated by a Mongolian people adept at horsemanship and hence at war; the latter drove
the former into the most inhospitable arctic regions where they certainly would not have
spread of their own accord.<a href="#fn3">3</a> Again, it is the same with the Finns who
in the most northerly part of Europe are called Lapps; Goths and Sarmatians have separated
them from the Hungarians to whom they are related in language. What can have driven the
Eskimos, a race entirely distinct from all others in America and perhaps descended from
primeval European adventurers, so far into the North, or the Pescherais as far south as
Tierra del Fuego, if it were not war which nature uses to populate the whole earth? War
itself requires no special motive but appears to be engrafted on human nature; it passes
even for something noble, to which the love of glory impels men quite apart from any
selfish urges. Thus among the American savages, just as much as among those of Europe
during the age of chivalry, military valor is held to be of great worth in itself, not
only during war (which is natural) but in order that there should be war. Often war is
waged only in order to show valor; thus an inner dignity is ascribed to war itself, and
even some philosophers have praised it as an ennoblement of humanity, forgetting the
pronouncement of the Greek who said, &quot;War is an evil inasmuch as it produces more
wicked men than it takes away.&quot; So much for the measures nature takes to lead the
human race, considered as a class of animals, to her own end.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Now we come to the question concerning that which is most essential in
the design of perpetual peace: What has nature done with regard to this end which man's
own reason makes his duty? That is, what has nature done to favor man's moral purpose, and
how has she guaranteed (by compulsion but without prejudice to his freedom) that he shall
do that which he ought to but does not do under the laws of freedom? This question refers
to all three phases of public law, namely, civil law, the law of nations, and the law of
world citizenship. If I say of nature that she wills that this or that occur, I do not
mean that she imposes a duty on us to do it, for this can be done only by free practical
reason; rather I mean that she herself does it, whether we will or not <i>(fata volentem </i><em>ducunt,
nolentem trahunt </em></font><font size="2">[&quot;Fates<b> </b>lead the<b> </b>willing,
drive the<b> </b>unwilling&quot; (Seneca <i>Epist. </i><em>mor</em>.<b> </b>XVIII.)] </font></p>

<p><font size="3">1<b>. </b>Even if a people were not forced by internal discord to submit
to public laws, war would compel them to do so, for we have already seen that nature has
placed each people near another which presses upon it, and against this it must form
itself into a state in order to defend itself. Now the republican constitution is the only
one entirely fitting to the rights of man. But it is the most difficult to establish and
even harder to preserve, so that many say a republic would have to be a nation of angels,
because men with their selfish inclinations are not capable of a constitution of such
sublime form. But precisely with these inclinations nature comes to the aid of the general
will established on reason, which is revered even though impotent in practice. Thus it is
only a question of a good organization of the state (which does lie in man's power),
whereby the powers of each selfish inclination are so arranged in opposition that one
moderates or destroys the ruinous effect of the other. The consequence for reason is the
same as if none of them existed, and man is forced to be a good citizen even if not a
morally good person.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The problem of organizing a state, however hard it may seem, can be
solved even for a race of devils, if only they are intelligent. The problem is:
&quot;Given a multitude of rational beings requiring universal laws for their
preservation, but each of whom is secretly inclined to exempt himself from them, to
establish a constitution in such a way that, although their private intentions conflict,
they check each other, with the result that their public conduct is the same as if they
had no such intentions.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A problem like this must be capable of solution; it does not require
that we know how to attain the moral improvement of men but only that we should know the
mechanism of nature in order to use it on men, organizing the conflict of the hostile
intentions present in a people in such a way that they must compel themselves to submit to
coercive laws. Thus a state of peace is established in which laws have force. We can see,
even in actual states, which are far from perfectly organized, that in their foreign
relations they approach that which the idea of right prescribes. This is so in spite of
the fact that the intrinsic element of morality is certainly not the cause of it. (A good
constitution is not to be expected from morality, but, conversely, a good moral condition
of a people is to be expected only under a good constitution.) Instead of genuine
morality, the mechanism of nature brings it to pass through selfish inclinations, which
naturally conflict outwardly but which can be used by reason as a means for its own end,
the sovereignty of law, and, as concerns the state, for promoting and securing internal
and external peace.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This, then, is the truth of the matter: Nature inexorably wills that the
right should finally triumph. What we neglect to do comes about by itself, though with
great inconveniences to us. &quot;If you bend the reed too much, you break it; and he who
attempts too much attempts nothing&quot; (Bouterwek).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">2. The idea of international law presupposes the separate existence of
many independent but neighboring states. Although this condition is itself a state of war
(unless a federative union prevents the outbreak of hostilities), this is rationally
preferable to the amalgamation of states under one superior power, as this would end in
one universal monarchy, and laws always lose in vigor what government gains in extent;
hence a soulless despotism falls into anarchy after stifling the seeds of the good.
Nevertheless, every state, or its ruler, desires to establish lasting peace in this way,
aspiring if possible to rule the whole world. But nature wills otherwise., She employs two
means to separate peoples and to prevent them from mixing: differences of language and of
religion.<a href="#fn4">4</a> These differences involve a tendency to mutual hatred and
pretexts for war, but the progress of civilization and men's gradual approach to- greater
harmony in their principles finally leads to peaceful agreement. This is not like that
peace which despotism (in the burial ground of freedom) produces through a weakening of
all powers; it is, on the contrary, produced and maintained by their equilibrium in
liveliest competition.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">3. Just as nature wisely separates nations, which the will of every
state, sanctioned by the principles of international law, would gladly unite by artifice
or force, nations which could not have secured themselves against violence and war by
means of the law of world citizenship unite because of mutual interest. The spirit of
commerce, which is incompatible with war, sooner or later gains the upper hand in every
state. As the power of money is perhaps the most dependable of all the powers (means)
included under the state power, states see themselves forced, without any moral urge, to
promote honorable peace and by mediation to prevent war wherever it threatens to break
out. They do so exactly as if they stood in perpetual alliances, for great offensive
alliances are in the nature of the case rare and even less often successful.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In this manner nature guarantees perpetual peace by the mechanism of
human passions. Certainly she does not do so with sufficient certainty for us to predict
the future in any theoretical sense, but adequately from a practical point of view, making
it our duty to work toward this end, which is not just a chimerical one. </font></p>

<h3 align="center"><font size="5">FOOTNOTES TO THE FIRST SUPPLEMENT</font></h3>

<p><font size="4"><a name="fn1">1.</a> </font><font size="3">In the mechanism of nature,
to which man belongs as, a sensuous being, a form is exhibited which is basic to its
existence; we can conceive of this form only as dependent upon the end to which the Author
of the world has previously destined it. This predetermination we call &quot;divine
providence&quot; generally, and so far as it is exercised at the beginning of the world we
call it &quot;founding providence&quot; (<em>Provi</em><i>dentia conditrix; semel iussit,
semper </i><em>parent</em>--Augustine).</font><font size="2">[&quot;Providence is a
founder; once she orders, they always obey.&quot;]</font><font size="3"> As maintaining
nature in its course by universal laws of design, it is called &quot;ruling
providence&quot; (<em>providentia gubernatrix</em>); as directing nature to ends not
foreseen by man and only conjectured from the actual result, it is called &quot;guiding
providence&quot; <i>(providentia directrix). </i>With respect to single events as divine
ends, it is no longer called &quot;providence&quot; but &quot;dispensation&quot; <i>(directio
</i><em>extraordinaria</em>). But since &quot;divine dispensation&quot; indicates
miracles, even if the events themselves are not called such, it is a foolish pretension of
man to wish to interpret them as such, since it is absurd to infer from a single event to
a particular principle of the efficient cause, namely, that this event is an end and not
merely a mechanical corollary of another end wholly unknown to us</font><font size="4">. </font><font
size="3">However pious and humble such talk may be, it is full of self conceit. The
division of providence, considered not formally but materially, i.e., with respect to
objects in the world to which it is directed, into either general or particular
providence, is false and</font><font size="4"> </font><font size="3">self-contradictory.
(This division appears, for instance, in the statement that providence cares for the
preservation of the species but leaves individuals to chance.) It is contradictory because
it is called universal in its purpose, and therefore no single thing can be excluded from
it. Presumably, therefore, a formal distinction is intended, according to the way in which
providence seeks its ends. This is the distinction between the ordinary and the special
ways of providence. (Under the former we may cite the annual dying-out and rebirth of
nature with the changes of the season; under the latter, the transport of wood by ocean
currents to arctic lands where it cannot grow, yet where it is needed by the inhabitants
who could not live without it.) Although we can very well explain the physico-mechanical
cause of these extraordinary cases (e.g., by reference to the wooded banks of rivers in
temperate lands, the failing of trees into the rivers, and then their being carried along
by the Gulf Stream), we must not overlook the teleological cause, which intimates the
foresight of a wisdom commanding over nature.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The concept of intervention or concurrence (<em>concursus</em>) in
producing an effect in the world of sense must be given up, though it is quite usual in
the schools. For to try to pair the disparate (<em>gryphes iungere equis </em>[</font><font
size="2">Griffins shall mate with mares.&quot;-An allusion to Virgil, <i>Eclogue </i>Vill.]</font><font
size="3">), and to let that which is itself the perfect cause of events in the world
supplement its own predetermining providence in the course of the world (which would
therefore have to have been inadequate), is self-contradictory. We fall into this
self-contradiction, for example, when we say that next to God it was the physician who
cured the ill, as if God had been his helper. For <i>causa solitaria non iuvat; </i>God is
the author of the physician and all his medicines, and if we insist on ascending to the
highest but theoretically inconceivable first cause, the effect must- be ascribed entirely
to Him. Or we can ascribe it entirely to the physician, so far as we consider the
occurrence as explicable in a chain of causes under the order of nature.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">But, besides being self-contradictory, such a mode of thought brings an
end to all definite principles in judging an effect. In a morally practical point of view,
however, which is directed exclusively to the supersensuous, the concept of the divine <em>concursus</em>
is quite suitable and even necessary. We find this, for instance, in the belief </font><font
size="2">that God </font><font size="3">will compensate for our own lack of justice,
provided -our intention was genuine; that He will do so by means that are inconceivable to
us, and that therefore we should not relent in our endeavor after the good. But it is
self-evident that no one should try to explain a good action (as an event in the world) as
a result of this concursus, for this would be a vain theoretical knowledge of the
supersensuous and therefore absurd.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><a name="fn2">2.</a> Among all modes of life there is undoubtedly none
more opposed to a civilized constitution than that of hunting, because families which must
dwell separately soon become strangers and, scattered in extensive forests, also enemies,
since each needs a great deal of space for obtaining food and clothing. The Noachic ban on
blood (Genesis 9:4-6) (which was imposed by the baptized Jews as a condition on the later
Christians who were converted from heathenism, though in a different connection--see The
Acts 15:20; 21:25) seems to have been originally nothing more than a prohibition against
the hunting life, because here raw flesh must often have been eaten; when the latter was
forbidden, so also was the former. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><a name="fn3">3.</a> One could ask: If nature willed that these icy
coasts should not remain uninhabited, what would become of the inhabitants if nature ever
failed (as might be expected) to bring driftwood to them? For it is reasonable to believe
that, in the progress of civilization, the occupants of the temperate zone would make
better use of the wood along rivers than simply to let it fall into the water and be
carried to the sea. I answer: If nature compels them to peace, the dwellers along the Ob,
the Yenisei, or the Lena will bring it to them, exchanging it for animal products in which
the sea around the Arctic coasts abounds. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><a name="fn4">4.</a> Difference of religion--a singular expression! It
is precisely as if one spoke of different moralities. There may very well be different
kinds of historical faiths attached to different means employed in the promotion of
religion, and they belong merely in the field of learned investigation. Similarly there
may be different religious texts (Zendavesta, the Veda, the Koran, etc.), but such
differences do not exist in religion, there being only one religion valid for all men and
in all ages. These can, therefore, be nothing else than accidental vehicles of religion,
thus changing with times and places. </font></p>
