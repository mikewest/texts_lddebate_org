<h3 align="center"><font size="3">SECOND SUPPLEMENT</font></h3>

<p align="center"><font size="3">&nbsp;SECRET ARTICLE FOR
PERPETUAL PEACE</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A secret article in contracts under public law
is objectively, i.e., from the standpoint of its content, a
contradiction. Subjectively, however, a secret clause can be
present in them, because the persons who dictate it might find it
compromising to their dignity to declare openly that they are its
authors.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The only article of this kind is contained in
the statement: &quot;The opinions of philosophers on the
conditions of the possibility of public peace shall be consulted
by those states armed for war.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">But it appears humiliating to the legislative
authority of a state, to whom we must naturally attribute the
utmost wisdom, to seek instruction from subjects (the
philosophers) on principles of conduct toward other states. It is
nevertheless very advisable to do so. Therefore, the state
tacitly and secretly invites them to give their opinions, that
is, the state will let them publicly and freely talk about the
general maxims of warfare and of the establishment of peace (for
they will do that of themselves, provided they are not forbidden
to do so). It does not require a particular convention among
states to see that this is done, since their agreement on this
point lies in an obligation already established by universal
human reason which is morally legislative.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I do not mean that the state should give the
principles of philosophers any preference over the decisions of
lawyers (the representatives of the state power); I only ask that
they be given a hearing. The lawyer, who has made not only the
scales of right but also the sword of justice his symbol,
generally uses the latter not merely to keep back all foreign
influences from the former, but, if the scale does not sink the
way he wishes, he also throws the sword into it <i>(vae victis), </i>a
practice to which he often has the greatest temptation because he
is not also a philosopher, even in morality. His office is only
to apply positive laws, not to inquire whether they might not
need improvement. The administrative function, which is the lower
one in his faculty, he counts as the higher because it is
invested with power (as is the case also with the other
faculties). The philosophical faculty occupies a very low rank
against this allied power. Thus it is said of philosophy, for
example, that she is the handmaiden to theology, and the other
faculties claim as much. But one does not see distinctly whether
she precedes her mistress with a flambeau or follows bearing her
train.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">That kings should philosophize or philosophers
become kings is not to be expected. Nor is it to be wished, since
the possession of power inevitably corrupts the untrammeled
judgment of reason. But kings or kinglike peoples which rule
themselves under laws of equality should not suffer the class of
philosophers to disappear or to be silent, but should let them
speak openly. This is indispensable to the enlightenment of the
business of government, and, since the class of philosophers is
by nature incapable of plotting and lobbying, it is above
suspicion of being made up of propagandists.</font></p>
